 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       Derivative Works;
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
       must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
       may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
       terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
       hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
       You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
       access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
       License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
       create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
       Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the
       Original Author, as requested.
    b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
       You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the
       Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are
       utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the
       Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the
       case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
       the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
       Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
       credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
       that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum
       such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
       appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
       authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
    a. By offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
       represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
       reasonable inquiry:
          i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the
             license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
             rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay
             any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other
             payments;
         ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity
             rights, common law rights or any other right of any third party or
             constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious injury
             to any third party.
    b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING
       OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
       WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF
       THE WORK.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
 AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM
 BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
 YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
 LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
       Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
       terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
       compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
       survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
       Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
       Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
       any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
       withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
       to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
       Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
       this License.
    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
       Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
       same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
       License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
       remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
       parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
       consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
       by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
       respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
       agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
       appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
       without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
    a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
       encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
       with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
       independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
       work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
       Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
       other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
       dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
       art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
       the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
       constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
       for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
       the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
       considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
       terms of this License.
    d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
    e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
       of this License.
    f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
       who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
       the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
       exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       Derivative Works.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
          i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
             performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for
             the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
             of the Work.
         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
             rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
             royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
             version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
             by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
             other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
       where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
       to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society
       (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
       webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
       Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
       jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.

       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
       may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
       terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
       hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
       You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
       access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
       License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
       create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
       Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the
       Original Author, as requested.
    b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
       You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the
       Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are
       utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the
       Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
       extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
       that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
       does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
       Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
       of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
       by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
       Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
       provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
       Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
       authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such
       other comparable authorship credit.
 .

 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
 member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
 schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
 of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
 Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
 the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
 recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
 under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
 must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
 disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
 may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
 rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
 Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
 this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
 upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
 remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
 requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
 You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
 parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
 parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
 reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
 associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
 copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
 consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
 identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
 translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
 original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
 that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
 will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
 or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
 For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
 by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
 explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
 endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
 as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
 express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
 Attribution Parties.
 .
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
 derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
 the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
 jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
 in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
 deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
 action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
 Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
 fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
 to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
 (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
 Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
 any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
 withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
 required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
 License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
 stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
 and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
 License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
 appear in any communication from You.
 .
 e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
 of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
 for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
 September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
 the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
 rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
 which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
 corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
 provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
 rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
 not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
 included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
 license of any rights under applicable law.

 License

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
    a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
       encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
       with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
       independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
       work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
       Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
       other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
       dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
       art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
       the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
       constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
       for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
       the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
       considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
       terms of this License.
    d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
    e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
       of this License.
    f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
       who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
       the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
       exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
    g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
       selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
       Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
       Derivative Works.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
          i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
             performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for
             the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
             of the Work.
         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
             rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
             royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
             version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
             by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
             other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
       where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
       to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society
       (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
       webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
       Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
       jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
       must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
       may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
       terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
       hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
       You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
       access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
       License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
       create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
       Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative
       Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the
       Original Author, as requested.
    b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,
       a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
       License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
       License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan).
       You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every
       copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
       display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict
       the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
       granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
       Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or
       use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
       Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
       License.
    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
       You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the
       Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are
       utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the
       Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
       extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
       that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
       does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
       Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
       of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
       by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
       Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
       provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
       Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
       authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such
       other comparable authorship credit.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
 AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
 MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective
       Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
       terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
       compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
       survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
       Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
       Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
       any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
       withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
       to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
       Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
       this License.
    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
       Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
       same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
       License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
       remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
       parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

       consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
       by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

       respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
       agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may

             of the Work.
         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
             exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
             rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
             royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
             version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
             by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
             other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
       where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
       to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society
       (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
       webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
       Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
       jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
       must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
       may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the
       terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
       hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
       You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
       access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
       License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
       create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as
       required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
       from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as
       requested.
    b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License,
       a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
       License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
       License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan).
       You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License or other license specified in the previous sentence with every
       copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
       display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict
       the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
       granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
       Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or
       use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
       Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
       Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
       the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
       License.
    c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
       You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
       reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
       Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
       the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
       (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
       Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
       means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
       supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
       Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
       Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
       information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
       identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
       translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
       original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
       reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative
       Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
       other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
       prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
 .

    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective

       terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
       compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
       survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
       Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
       Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
       any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
       withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
       to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

       Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under

    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the

       parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
       consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
       by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
       respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
       agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
       appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
       without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .

 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
     recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
     derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
     License.
  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
     of adaptations of works made available under that license under this
     License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
     License Elements as this License.
  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or

     offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

     musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
     play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
     expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
     being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
     performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
     organization that transmits the broadcast.
  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
     of this License including without limitation any production in the
     literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
     form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
     of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
     choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
     a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
     extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
     a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
     considered a literary or artistic work.
  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
     violation.
  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
     to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
     place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
     by any means or process and the communication to the public of the

  k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
     without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
     fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
     protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
     medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
     to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
     original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
     modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
     in Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
         of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
         Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
         voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
     the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
     to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
     measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
     the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
     incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
     apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
     as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
     Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
     Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
     the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
     jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
     Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
     License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
     mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
     you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
     mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
     comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
     the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
     License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
     License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
     Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
     of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,
     You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
     Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation
     from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
     terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the
     Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
     the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
     the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
     and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
     or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
     attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
     terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
     extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
     specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
     refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
     and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
     "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
     required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable
     manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or
     Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
     contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
     part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
     credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
     doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
     purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
     Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
     assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
     of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
     written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
     take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
     prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
     agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
     of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
     make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
     modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
     Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
     as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
     applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
     right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
     but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
     Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
     any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
     stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
     the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
     by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
     enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
     for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
     September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
     and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
     These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
     applicable law.

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
   m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

         recombined usage employing "sampling," "collage," "mash-up,"
         or other comparable artistic technique, whether now known or
         hereafter devised, that is highly transformative of the
         original, as appropriate to the medium, genre, and market
         niche; and
 .
         Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of the
         original Work, or if You choose to use the original Work as a
         whole, You must either use the Work as an insubstantial
         portion of Your Derivative Work(s) or transform it into
         something substantially different from the original Work. In
         the case of a musical Work and/or audio recording, the mere
         synchronization ("synching") of the Work with a moving image
         shall not be considered a transformation of the Work into
         something substantially different.
 .
     You may distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
     perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission, any Derivative Work(s) authorized under this
     License.
 .
     Prohibition on advertising. All advertising and promotional uses
     are excluded from the above rights, except for advertisement and
     promotion of the Derivative Work(s) that You are creating from the
     Work and Yourself as the author thereof.
 .
     Noncommercial sharing of verbatim copies permitted.
 .
         You may reproduce the Work, incorporate the Work into one or
         more Collective Works, and reproduce the Work as incorporated
         in the Collective Works. You may distribute copies or
         phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
         perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
         Work including or incorporated in Collective Works.
 .
         You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in the
         paragraph immediately above in any manner that is primarily
         intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
         private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for
         other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
         otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
         directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
         compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
         compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted
         works.
 .
     Attribution and Notice.
 .
         If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
         publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
         Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
         for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to
         the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name
         (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if
         supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
         reasonably practicable, provide the Uniform Resource
         Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated
         with the Work or a Derivative Work, unless such Uniform
         Resource Identifier does not refer to the copyright notice or
         licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a
         Derivative Work, provide a credit identifying the use of the
         Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "Remix of the Work by
         Original Author," or "Inclusion of a portion of the Work by
         Original Author in collage"). Such credit may be implemented
         in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case
         of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
         credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
         credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such
         other comparable authorship credit.
 .
         You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform or
         publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of
         this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
         Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
         phonorecord of the Work or Derivative Work You distribute,
         publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
         perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
         that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
         recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
         not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
         refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
         may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
         publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
         measures that control access of use of the Work in a manner
         inconsistent with the terms of this License. The above applies
         to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
         does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work
         itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. Upon
         notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
         remove from the Derivative Work or Collective Work any
         reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
         requested.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE BY THE PARTIES IN A SEPARATE WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE.
 .
 5. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 6. Termination
 .
     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
     License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
     Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
     or entities remain in full compliance with those
     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will survive any
     termination of this License.
 .
     Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
     here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
     the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
     to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been granted under the terms of this License),
     and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
     terminated as stated above.
 .
 7. Miscellaneous
 .
     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
     a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
     to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
     granted to You under this License.
 .
     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
     Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
     granted to You under this License.
 .
     If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 .
     No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 .
     This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements, or representations with respect to the
     Work, and with respect to the subject matter hereof, not specified
     above. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
     that may appear in any communication from You. This License may
     not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the
     Licensor and You.

 Free Art License
 .
 http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/
 .
 version 1.2
 .
 Preamble :
 .
 With this Free Art License, you are authorised to copy, distribute and freely
 transform the work of art while respecting the rights of the originator.
 .
 Far from ignoring the author's rights, this license recognises them and
 protects them. It reformulates their principle while making it possible for
 the public to make creative use of the works of art. Whereas current literary
 and artistic property rights result in restriction of the public's access to
 works of art, the goal of the Free Art License is to encourage such access.
 .
 The intention is to make work accessible and to authorise the use of its
 resources by the greatest number of people: to use it in order to increase its
 use, to create new conditions for creation in order to multiply the
 possibilities of creation, while respecting the originators in according them
 recognition and defending their moral rights.
 .
 In fact, with the arrival of the digital age, the invention of the Internet
 and free software, a new approach to creation and production has made its
 appearance. It also encourages a continuation of the process of
 experimentation undertaken by many contemporary artists.
 .
 Knowledge and creativity are resources which, to be true to themselves, must
 remain free, i.e. remain a fundamental search which is not directly related to
 a concrete application. Creating means discovering the unknown, means
 inventing a reality without any heed to realism. Thus, the object(ive) of art
 is not equivalent to the finished and defined art object. This is the basic
 aim of this Free Art License: to promote and protect artistic practice freed
 from the rules of the market economy.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 - The work of art : A communal work which includes the initial artwork as well
 as all subsequent contributions (subsequent originals and copies). It is
 created at the initiative of the original artist who, by this license, defines
 the conditions according to which the contributions are made.
 .
 - The original work of art : This is the artwork created by the initiator of
 the communal work, of which copies will be modified by whosoever wishes.
 .
 - Subsequent works : These are the additions put forward by the artists who
 contribute to the formation of the work by taking advantage of the right to
 reproduction, distribution and modification that this license confers on them.
 .
 - The Original (the work's source or resource) : A dated example of the work,
 of its definition, of its partition or of its program which the originator
 provides as the reference for all future updatings, interpretations, copies or
 reproductions.
 .
 - Copy : Any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.
 .
 - The author or the artist of the original work of art: This is the person who
 created the work which is at the heart of the ramifications of this modified
 work of art. By this license, the author determines the conditions under which
 these modifications are made.
 .
 - Contributor: Any person who contributes to the creation of the work of art.
 He is the author or the artist of an original art object resulting from the
 modification of a copy of the initial artwork or the modification of a copy of
 a subsequent work of art.
 .
 1. AIMS
 .
 The aim of this license is to define the conditions according to which you can
 use this work freely.
 .
 2. EXTENT OF THE USAGE
 .
 This work of art is subject to copyright, and the author, by this license,
 specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute and modify it.
 .
 2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR OF REPRODUCTION)
 .
 You have the right to copy this work of art for your personal use, for your
 friends or for any other person, by employing whatever technique you choose.
 .
 2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO INTERPRET (OR OF REPRESENTATION)
 .
 You can freely distribute the copies of these works, modified or not, whatever
 their medium, wherever you wish, for a fee or for free, if you observe all the
 following conditions: - attach this license, in its entirety, to the copies or
 indicate precisely where the license can be found, - specify to the recipient
 the name of the author of the originals, - specify to the recipient where he
 will be able to access the originals (original and subsequent). The author of
 the original may, if he wishes, give you the right to broadcast/distribute the
 original under the same conditions as the copies.
 .
 2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
 .
 You have the right to modify the copies of the originals (original and
 subsequent), partially or otherwise, respecting the conditions set out in
 article 2.2 , in the event of distribution (or representation) of the modified
 copy. The author of the original may, if he wishes, give you the right to
 modify the original under the same conditions as the copies.
 .
 3. INCORPORATION OF ARTWORK
 .
 All the elements of this work of art must remain free, which is why you are
 not allowed to integrate the originals (originals and subsequents) into
 another work which would not be subject to this license.
 .
 4. YOUR AUTHOR'S RIGHTS
 .
 The object of this license is not to deny your author's rights on your
 contribution. By choosing to contribute to the evolution of this work of art,
 you only agree to give to others the same rights with regard to your
 contribution as those which were granted to you by this license.
 .
 5. DURATION OF THE LICENCE
 .
 This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its provisions. The fact of
 copying, distributing, or of modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement.
 This license will remain in force for as long as the copyright which is
 attached to the work of art. If you do not respect the terms of this license,
 you automatically lose the rights that it confers. If the legal status to
 which you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect the terms of this
 license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.
 .
 6. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENCE
 .
 This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by
 its authors (instigators of the "copyleft attitude" movement) by way of new,
 numbered versions.
 .
 You will have the choice of accepting the provisions contained in the version
 under which the copy was communicated to you, or alternatively, to use the
 provisions of one of the subsequent versions.
 .
 7. SUB-LICENSING
 .
 Sub-licenses are not authorized by the present license. Any person who wishes
 to make use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the author
 of the original work.
 .
 8. THE LAW APPLICABLE TO THIS CONTRACT
 .
 This license is subject to French law.
 .
 DIRECTIONS FOR USE :
 .
 - How to use the Free Art license?
 .
 To benefit from the Free Art License, it is enough to specify the following on
 your work of art:
 .
 [- A few lines to indicate the name of the work and to give an idea of what it
 is.] [- A few lines to describe, if necessary, the modified work of art and
 give the name of the author/artist.] Copyright © [the date] [name of the
 author or artist] (if appropriate, specify the names of the previous authors
 or artists) Copyleft: this work of art is free, you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it according to terms of the Free Art license. You will find a specimen
 of this license on the site Copyleft Attitude http://artlibre.org as well as
 on other sites.
 .
 - Why use the Free Art license?
 .
 1 / to give the greatest number of people access to your work.
 .
 2 / to allow it to be freely distributed.
 .
 3 / to allow it to evolve by authorising its transformation by others.
 .
 4 / to be able, yourself, to use the resources of a work when it is under Free
 Art license: to copy, distribute or transform it freely.
 .
 5 / This is not all: because the use of the Free Art License is also a good
 way to take liberties with the marketing system generated by the dominant
 economy. The Free Art License offers a useful legal protocol to prevent
 abusive appropriation. It will no longer be possible for someone to
 appropriate your work, short-circuiting the creative process to make personal
 profit from it. Helping yourself to a collective work in progress will be
 forbidden, as will monopolising the resources of an evolving creation for the
 benefit of a few.
 .
 The Free Art License advocates an economy appropriate for art, based on
 sharing, exchange and joyful giving. What counts in art is also and mostly
 what is not counted.
 .
 - When to use the Free Art License ?
 .
 It is not the goal of the Free Art License to eliminate copyright or author's
 rights. Quite the opposite, it is about reformulating the relevance of these
 rights while taking today's environment into account. It is about the right to
 freedom of movement, to free copying and to free transformation of works of
 art. The right to work in freedom for art and artists.
 .
 1 / Each time you want to use or put this right into practice, use the Free
 Art License.

 - To which types of art can the Free Art License be applied?
 .
 This license can be applied to digital as well as to non-digital art. It was
 born out of observation of the world of free software and the Internet, but
 its applicability is not limited to the digital media. You can put a painting,
 a novel, a sculpture, a drawing, a piece of music, a poem, an installation, a
 video, a film, a recipe, a CD-rom, a Web site, or a performance under the Free
 Art License, in short any creation which has some claim to be a work of art.
 .
 This license has a history: it was born at the meeting " Copyleft Attitude "
 which took place at "Accès Local" and "Public" in Paris at the beginning of
 the year 2000. For the first time, it brought computer specialists and
 freeware activists together with contemporary artists and members of the art
 world.
